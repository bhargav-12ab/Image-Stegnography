# Image Stegnography

**Project Overview** 

This project implements Image Steganography using the Java programming language. The application allows users to hide secret messages inside an image, which can later be extracted without degrading the quality of the original image. The graphical user interface (GUI) was developed using NetBeans IDE for an intuitive user experience.

**Features**
Message Hiding: Hide text messages within images using steganography techniques.
Message Extraction: Extract hidden messages from steganographed images.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use GUI built with NetBeans.
Secure and Efficient: Ensures the message remains hidden without visible changes to the image.
File Support: Supports common image formats such as .png, .bmp, and .jpg.

**Technologies Used**
Programming Language: Java
IDE: NetBeans
Concept: Image Steganography (Least Significant Bit - LSB method)

**Requirements**
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
NetBeans IDE (Optional for modifications)
Image Files: Input images in .png or .bmp format
